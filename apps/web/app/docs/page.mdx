# Introduction

Convert Buddy is a streaming data processing engine that performs conversion, transformation, and detection with visible performance telemetry. It is built for non-developers converting data in the browser, and for developers embedding the engine in applications.

## What you get

- Browser-based conversion with deterministic memory usage.
- WebAssembly-powered streaming core.
- Telemetry emitted at fixed intervals.

## Minimal example

```ts
await convertToString(file, { outputFormat: "json" });
```

## Advanced example

```ts
const buddy = new ConvertBuddy({
  inputFormat: "csv",
  outputFormat: "json",
  transform: (r) => ({ ...r, source: "browser" }),
  onProgress: (stats) => console.log(stats.throughputMbPerSec)
});
```
