# FAQ

## Does Convert Buddy upload my files?

No. Conversion runs locally in the browser or in your Node process.

## Can I see performance during conversion?

Yes. Telemetry emits throughput, memory, and elapsed time at fixed intervals.

## Minimal example

```ts
await convertToString(file, { outputFormat: "json" });
```

## Advanced example

```ts
const buddy = new ConvertBuddy({
  onProgress: (stats) => console.log(stats.throughputMbPerSec)
});
```
